# the idea for ideapad

did you ever - perhaps just for a moment - wonder what it would be like to write a paragraph, or a note, without adhering to the formal rigors of puncutation and capitalisation?

did you ever harbor the mutinous idea that those writing in languages without capitalisation - hebrew, arabic, among others - might have an inherent advantage in capturing their ideas into digital systems because, unlike those of us writing in pesky english, they don't have to reach for the shift key every few words?

after a few cups of coffee, i have convinced myself that:

a - this idea isn't entirely crazy
b - it might be cool to create a notepad specifically for encouraging this kind of text capture

so here's what i'm thinking:

while typing in all lowercase might be fun, linguistic and social conventions decree that text be properly capitalised when sharing the world. but how hard could it be to use some basic nlp to programatically convert text from lowercase 'freeform' style into real-world style (adding missing capitals and inferring correct punctuation?)

this is my idea for this "micro-project" - create an experimentary notepad. a folder for 'raw' ideas. a folder for those with fixed-up punctuation. and a simple button to copy from a to b when you're ready.
